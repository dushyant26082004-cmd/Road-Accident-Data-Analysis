# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
## Project Objectives
 Developed an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard in Excel to analyze 300,000+ casualty records and identify key safety trends.
 Visualized Total, Fatal, Serious, and Slight casualties using KPI cards and donut charts for quick insights.
 Performed year-over-year and monthly trend analysis to compare current vs previous year accident patterns.
 Analyzed casualties across multiple dimensions: vehicle type, road type, road surface, light conditions, and urban vs rural areas.
