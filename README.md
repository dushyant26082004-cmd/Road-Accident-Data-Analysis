## Project Objectives
 Developed an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard in Excel to analyze 300,000+ casualty records and identify key safety trends.
 Visualized Total, Fatal, Serious, and Slight casualties using KPI cards and donut charts for quick insights.
 Performed year-over-year and monthly trend analysis to compare current vs previous year accident patterns.
 Analyzed casualties across multiple dimensions: vehicle type, road type, road surface, light conditions, and urban vs rural areas.

## Questions(KPI's)
What is the total number of casualties?
How many fatal, serious, and slight casualties occurred?
What percentage of total casualties are fatal accidents?
How does the current year (CY) casualties compare to previous year (PY)?
Which month recorded the highest number of accidents?
Is there a seasonal trend in road accidents?
Which vehicle type contributes to the highest casualties?
Which road surface condition (dry, wet, snow/ice) is most dangerous?
What percentage of accidents occur on wet roads?
Many More

## Project Insights 
Single carriageways contribute the highest number of casualties, indicating a greater safety risk compared to dual carriageways and roundabouts.
Urban areas report significantly higher casualties than rural areas, mainly due to traffic density and congestion.
Car-related accidents account for the largest share of total casualties, making them the primary focus area for safety interventions.
Dry road conditions still show the highest number of accidents, suggesting that accident volume is driven more by traffic exposure than weather alone.
Daylight conditions have more accidents than dark conditions, indicating higher traffic movement rather than visibility issues.
Month-wise trend analysis shows seasonal variation, with certain months recording consistently higher accident rates.
Current year vs previous year comparison reveals fluctuation, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and policy evaluation.
Fatal casualties form a small percentage of total accidents, but their impact is critical and requires targeted safety measures.
## Final Conclusion
The dashboard provides a holistic and data-driven view of road accident patterns, enabling stakeholders to identify high-risk conditions, locations, and vehicle categories.
Insights suggest that infrastructure improvement on single carriageways, stricter urban traffic control, and vehicle-specific safety policies can significantly reduce casualties.
The use of interactive filters and KPIs allows decision-makers to quickly drill down into problem areas and monitor trends over time.
Overall, this project demonstrates how advanced Excel analytics and dashboarding can support effective road safety planning and policy-making.
